        <p>This summer IQ Solutions wrapped up our “Knowledge Improves Lives” speaker series by inviting user experience and content strategy expert <strong>Karen McGrane</strong> to talk about optimizing your online content so it can reach all devices, channels, and just about anything else used by audiences to access information. As Karen put it, by choosing to treat your content as a service, your organization can move away from simply pouring content into documents to allowing others to query that content for use. She hit on this topic from several angles throughout <strong>her presentation.</strong> Her point illustrates a main theme of the White House’s Digital Government Strategy: treat all content as data and “architect for interoperability and openness.” Some highlights of HHS openness in action include the <strong>HHS Digital Media API Platform </strong>and HealthData.gov, which recently celebrated its <strong>1,000th data set.</strong> (Congratulations!)</p>

        <p>IQ Solutions has worked with many federal agencies to structure and open their public health information content as well as to build complex web apps with content unlocked by other agencies. This has allowed our clients to become device and platform agnostic, while freeing their content for multiple uses, including powering mobile apps and widgets. This approach has resulted in a broader but more targeted reach to audiences, with greater effect than previously realized.</p>

        <p>Regardless of where you are in planning your next digital project, here are some questions to consider to help get your open content strategies off the ground.</p>

        <h2>How Are You Defining Open Content?</h2>

        <p>At the heart of open content is structure. Similar to data, you need more granular control over your content to repurpose it for multiple uses—in other words, to open it up. For some organizations, this may mean pulling high-profile content out of a database and turning it into a developer-friendly API. Or it could mean syndicating your content to the HHS Digital Media Platform so other organizations can pick it up with a quick copy and paste. The <strong>Digital Services Innovation Center </strong>at the U.S. General Services Administration is also promoting open and structured content models that allow you to add rich metadata to your content to make it more shareable and “future-friendly.” These are all examples of open content in action. Although each provides a different flavor of open content, all are driven by structured content.</p>

        <h3>What are your open content goals?</h3>

        <p>Structured content will give you the ability to fight the upcoming zombie device apocalypse by making your content flexible, fluid, and able to go anywhere. You’ll be able to target new devices in the future without overhauling your entire system. Once you’re ready to open your content and allow others to use it, you’ll want to put some benchmarks in place to measure success. Do you want developers to build apps with your content? Are you hoping to increase traffic to your site and build new partnerships? Will you be able to track impressions of your content served on other sites to demonstrate that your organization has expanded its reach? These are some of the questions you should be asking as you launch your open content initiative.</p>
